## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Working together to resolve the authorization feature to enter the flashcards. Planning out what each of us need to finish.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Trouble getting through the authoriation feature. Not being on the same page with what features we each have to do.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Yes, but we needed more time on this section. We submitted late but the milestone #3 is complete.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] The streak counter for daily practice is at risk the most. We still working on the CRUD and search bar features.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] We would need support from ChatGPT if the TAs are unavailable to complete the assignment. We are planning to meet over the weekend to get more features completed.
