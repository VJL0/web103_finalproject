## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Working together to get the project completed in time. Fixing and adjusting our authorization feature.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Fixing the authorization feature without messing up other parts of the code.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] Not yet, but we are close to finishing. We will prioritize the remaining tasks that are essential to the basic application of the app such as CRUD featues and search bar feature. 

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] The at risk feature would be the favorites list/ booklist component, but also the streak counter for completing at least one quiz a day. The store feature was another idea for the app, but we ran out of time to even start on it. 

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 your answer here] To complete the upcoming units, we will use the support from the TAs to clarify any confusions and use ChatGPT to answer our problem whenever the TAs are unavaiable.
